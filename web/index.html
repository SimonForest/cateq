% A comment start with '%' and stops at the end of the line
% A 0-cell is defined like this:
x := gen *

% Several 0-cells can be defined using commas
y,z := gen *

% An (n+1)-cell between two n-cells is defined as follows
f := gen x -> y

% As before, we can define several such (n+1)-cells at the same time
g,h := gen x -> y
f',g',h' := gen y -> z

% Cells can be composed with *0, *1, etc.
% Identities are obtained by applying id1, id2, etc.
% Variables containing a cell can be defined using ':='
u := f *0 f'
v := f *0 g'
v' := id1 x *0 f *0 f'

% We ask whether two n-cells are equal with '='
u = u  % prints: true
u = v  % prints: false
u = v' % prints: true

% Let's add 2-cells
al := gen f -> g
be := gen g -> h
al' := gen f' -> g'
be' := gen g' -> h'

% Writing formulas with higher cells become quickly tiresome
(f *0 al') *1 ((al *1 be) *0 g') *1 (h *0 be') = (al *1 be) *0 (al' *1 be')

% cateq understands pasting diagrams
% pasting diagrams represent cells by the set of the generators "involved" in them
% cateq deduces how to compose the generators to build the cell
% pasting diagrams are introduced with '{ ... }'
{ f, f' } = f *0 f' % prints: true

% Of course, cateq checks that your pasting diagram is correct
% It fails otherwise
X := { f , g } % fails
Y := { x , g' } % fails
